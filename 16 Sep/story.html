                    <h1> About Me </h1>
                
                    <p>I’m Pranav Anand A J, a Computer and Communication Engineering student at Sri Eshwar College of
                        Engineering with a passion for software development and problem-solving. Through internships in
                        AWS
                        & DevOps and MERN Stack Web Development, I’ve gained hands-on experience in building
                        applications
                        and working with cloud infrastructure. I’ve developed projects like Dfetch (Attack Surface
                        Mapper),
                        a Railway Management System, and a Pet Care Shop website, while also solving 600+ coding
                        problems
                        across platforms like LeetCode and Skillrack. With skills in C, C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript, along with certifications in cloud and DSA, I aim to keep learning, creating, and
                        contributing to impactful tech solutions.</p>
                    <h2>My Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have developed projects like a Pet Care Shop website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which
                        provides an online platform for pet supplies, and a Railway Management System using SQL to
                        efficiently retrieve passenger and train details. These projects gave me practical exposure to
                        both
                        frontend development and database management, strengthening my problem-solving and
                        application-building skills.
